This project explores the Netflix dataset to uncover insights about its content library, trends, and patterns. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using Python libraries.

## üìÇ Dataset
- The dataset contains the following columns:
`show_id`, `type`, `title`, `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, `release_year`, `rating`, `duration`, `listed_in`, `description`

## Key Highlights:

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
